# d.inspectEHR

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of d.inspectEHR is to provide an early phase light touch quality evaluation for the DECOVID project.
Prior to running these reports, sites *must* apply the DECOVID ddls and *should* try to run ACHILLES against their OMOP database.

## Installation

You can install the development version of d.inspectEHR from [GitHub](https://www.github.com/DocEd/dinspectEHR) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("DocEd/d.inspectEHR")
```

## Running the Report

The report can be run by loading the package and running the following code.

```r
library(d.inspectEHR)
render_report(output = "DECOVID_report.html")
```

This will prompt a shiny interface to launch for you to enter your database connection details.
You can also supply these directly:

```r
library(d.inspectEHR)

render_report(
  output = "DECOVID_report.html",
  prams = list(
    driver = "PostgreSQL",
    host = "localhost",
    port = 5432,
    dbname = "omop",
    schema = "public",
    user = "w.flemming",
    password = "chromatin",
    local_hospital = "St. Elsewhere"
    )
  )
```

Grab a coffee and enjoy.
